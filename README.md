## Little info about me 🫶🏻
Born in Tula, Russia and living here almost for my entire life. I did move to Moscow for a little time window, but later returned. Also occasional business trips and vacations to Moscow and other cities. I love my reclusive lifestyle it helps me improve my programming skills and knowledge without distractions. Also maybe this part of the reason i love anime related stuff. I don't mind, it. I love my waifus ;)
