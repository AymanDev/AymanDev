## Life goals 📝
- [x] Create game and release it somewhere *(created 2 simple games as fan games for 2 VTuber's)*
- [x] Learn Rust *(can't say that i fully learned it, but i did port some of my games and apps to Rust. I return to it from time to time to experiment and learn more)* 
- [x] Create useful package *(created package for rendering react components into static html and css with work specifics in mind)*
- [x] Learn modeling basics in Blender *(created few simple models and keep learning how to do stuff)*
- [ ] Move to Japan *(in process of learning language and search of work inside Japan)*
- [ ] Create and release full 3d game *(i had a lot of experimentation in different engines and without them. Right now creating game in Godot)*
- [ ] Create game without game engine, but with some sort of libraries like Raylib.


## Little info about me 🫶🏻
Born and current live in Tula, Russia. I always had interest in how things get done be at computer on real goods production. This is how i started trying to find out how games is done and that's pretty much it how it all started. Experimenting with game files i played at the time and eventually moving to game engines. After some time i got interested in other fields and eventually landed in frontend development as my job currently. Nevertheless i keep trying and learning all sorts of fields not just related to web development. 

Also i'm in love with japanese culture be it modern(anime, manga, ranobe, music, games or urbanism) or more old(historical places and shrines).
